## Team invitations

Workspace owners and admins create single-use team links from Settings. Links
expire after seven days, can be revoked, and require a signed-in recipient to
explicitly confirm joining. Existing memberships keep their role. An existing
member opening a link does not consume it or gain additional privileges.

`20261015055940_workspace_invite_links.sql` provides the hashed-token table and
authenticated RPCs. Direct client access to the token table is denied. The
permission-checked RPCs intentionally use `SECURITY DEFINER` to add a membership
atomically after validating the invitation; raw tokens are returned only when
created. Legacy email-based signup invitation triggers are disabled. Pending
legacy email invites do not automatically add newly registered users.

Password-reset email requests and invitation email requests are paused in the
application UI. Supabase Auth settings are shared with other applications and
are not globally disabled by this change. Existing recovery links can still
complete a password update.

The headquarters management page is currently a proposal only. It has not been
implemented, and no cross-workspace access is granted by the invitation feature.
